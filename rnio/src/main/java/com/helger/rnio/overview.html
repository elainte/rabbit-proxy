<title>RNIO Overview</title>
</head>
<body>
The rnio package is a framework to builds clients or servers that utilize nio.

<p>To use rnio you create a {@link org.khelekore.rnio.NioHandler} and then you 
wait for the events that you want.

<p>In the background rnio will run a set of selector threads that handles all 
the low level interaction with the {@link java.nio.channels.Selector}s.
